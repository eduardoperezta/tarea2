//Input Example

_INPUT = 0;
wAB = [];//vector for squares
wR = [];//vector for results of square

//Expected Output

//Second Input Example (Remember to comment the first example in order
//and uncomment the next line in order test this case)

//_INPUT = "4\n1 8\n2 4\n10 13\n11 20";

//Expected Output
